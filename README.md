Borders are just there to facilitate international crime anyway...

I mean if you have to have borders, then the grass will be greener on the other side, I guess people will want to move to cross them... sort of causing your own problem there, but whatever.

Does international crime help us solve our real problems though, such as, society as a whole being willfully ignorant and rife with hypocrisy?

TLDR, Perhaps borders are really an issue bout how wealthy people hide money, it's too bad to drag desperate wage slaves into the debate at all.

Don't get me wrong... 

1) do borders defend "society" or does society defend itself in a borderless fashion?

exhibit 1:
Terrorism and Bathtubs: Comparing and Assessing the Risks

2) hey we got a problem with the border people, and those immigrants certainly won't just fall for fascism because they're fleeing it amiright?

3) we already have a problem with anti-patriotic constitution ignoring un-americanism... so wouldn't the immigrants naturally be just inherently even more so?

4) does divide and conquer only work, if you plan to conquer?

5) Isn't society a special club for just us?

TIL Bathtubs defend society from itself, more than I can say for society... but again even free speech is lost in this era... what they did to us on 09/11 or continue to do was never remotely unthinkable though, but let's ban it anyway, it's outside think.  Now we're so protected in our thought bubble nothing can hurt our feelings now!

True overpopulation will come with it's own revelations and devaluations... we'd be better off devaluing human life up front and avoiding it entirely.

Define what balance is anyway, is to say fairness, and is to say justice... certainly not arguing for unfair removals here... only fair fights to achieve balanced outcomes.  Murder is pretty lame and anti-heroic.... you've left no place for any true lethal contest of matched wits, and so it doesn't go anywhere.  What a bore.  The future is at a standstill... you've decided to put nothing on the line and let someone else tow it.  Let's never risk anything again what a great life that would be like.

It's all heresy and taboo until it's way too late and everyone is doing it.  

Hey society sucks, and they have to always fail at everything but the "head game" where the target audience is placated adult children who value one another a bit more than is sensible, but you can still vote.

Life is still missing it's outlet, so some will take up irrational battles against what is seen as society itself... if there were an outlet to die heroically for the greater good people would take that route... that's what you've left them in a battle to make everyone passive wage slaves in service of oppressive forces.  I'm still shocked how poorly aimed most attacks seem to be.

The actual truth is probably even worse than this.

If true good can't be achieved from within or without the system, yet hope is still left, then what is that?  Do systems change or do we just watch them die and pull ourselves out of the rubble afterwards?

In the _end_ I think stupid dies, but takes out _everyone_else_ with them.  Satisfactory?  Not really.  But if a small group of stupid take out another small group of definitely also containing stupid, because we all do anyway, should we really care?  Did evolution just occur?  It's still inadequate but fundamentally it worked,.... it subverted the real crisis where EVERYONE dies... by mirroring that tragedy but in a very small and (yes comparatively goes without saying) insignificant way, but it still felt significant... confused?  Why aren't we all!

The infancy of life - where are we and why are we utterly confused about this - the death of all life.

You'd be right, except life matters... that picture isn't hopeless yet, but the confusion is misplaced.  It matters and it's worthless, and yet it must go on... all in equal parts.

I'd still scream wake up but you wouldn't, most of us never do, and for all my screaming I won't wake up either.

The thrill of life is but one lethal instant that began when you were born and it ends, well, when you say it does.  Must we insist on it being downhill and with training wheels?

At some point even the dinosaurs would have wanted out of dino-society.

Society fails, society blames the victim (of brainless spineless society), society fails again.  Society watches yet its attention is placed on placating itself.

Some of what I'll consider true taboo will remain as such, it's unfortunate and necessary, but the menial real life and death stuff won't always stay down.  You can shut it out, and shut down all you want, but please stop commoditizing it (life)... it's denigrating to say it has value... it has matter, but "value" is a stretch the rich make to justify keeping us around... if it's really their world run by financial blinders and pure numbers, I'd rather be value-less non-asset to the astatine team that looks on us so selfishly as a means to a selfish end.

But sadly I know this to be banned wrong think.... but is it still because you don't understand?  Life is a greater force than life (singular) and we all seem completely inept about it.  Please call me when we all get over it because I think we can hang out and actually matter then, we're too busy stuck here being valued as a compartmentalized thing, to actually matter, and so atrophy ensues, and this slow death is every arguably worse than the end itself.

Sorry for thinking, I'd still say welcome everyone with open arms, because in the future when we come to our senses about life, it literally won't matter, not even a little bit.  No not life, but the fact there is an abundance of it, won't matter, because again that's a value framed way of looking at it, it's like saying life has value, well sure it does as a whole, but does it matter?  Well does your life matter (with point to throat)?  I guess you probably still won't get it... I'll inevitably confuse even myself about this, but the joke is the semantics, and that's not real humor, it's just funny games with english.

If you live life such that is has value, will it matter in the end?

If you continue to take life on as serious matter, will value abound?

Life is actually more along the lines of the thing where serious matter is left out... I mean sure we have bones, and they're pretty serious, but honestly seriousness is the plague on the soul.

Duty to a fault.  Value at it's finest.  Was it worthless in the end?  When matter was lost it became as such, yet even then it could still matter because others carried on.
