Borders are just there to facilitate international crime anyway...

I mean if you have to have borders, then the grass will be greener on the other side, I guess people will want to move to cross them... sort of causing your own problem there, but whatever.

Does international crime help us solve our real problems though, such as, society as a whole being willfully ignorant and rife with hypocrisy?

TLDR, Perhaps borders are really an issue bout how wealthy people hide money, it's too bad to drag desperate wage slaves into the debate at all.

Don't get me wrong... 

1) do borders defend "society" or does society defend itself in a borderless fashion?

exhibit 1:
Terrorism and Bathtubs: Comparing and Assessing the Risks

2) hey we got a problem with the border people, and those immigrants certainly won't just fall for fascism because they're fleeing it amiright?

3) we already have a problem with anti-patriotic constitution ignoring un-americanism... so wouldn't the immigrants naturally be just inherently even more so?

4) does divide and conquer only work, if you plan to conquer?

5) Isn't society a special club for just us?

(Context note, 2025-07-26 this points are not beliefs, in conflict, and failing the do not get me wrong test is basically guaranteed 205%... that being said they are intended to cause thought, or if not (*worst case scenario*) at least potentially challenge the reader to think, whether possible or not )

TIL Bathtubs defend society from itself, more than I can say for society... but again even free speech is lost in this era... what they did to us on 09/11 or continue to do was never remotely unthinkable though, but let's ban it anyway, it's outside think.  Now we're so protected in our thought bubble nothing can hurt our feelings now!

True overpopulation will come with it's own revelations and devaluations... we'd be better off devaluing human life up front and avoiding it entirely.

Define what balance is anyway, is to say fairness, and is to say justice... certainly not arguing for unfair removals here... only fair fights to achieve balanced outcomes.  Murder is pretty lame and anti-heroic.... you've left no place for any true lethal contest of matched wits, and so it doesn't go anywhere.  What a bore.  The future is at a standstill... you've decided to put nothing on the line and let someone else tow it.  Let's never risk anything again what a great life that would be like.

It's all heresy and taboo until it's way too late and everyone is doing it.  

Hey society sucks, and they have to always fail at everything but the "head game" where the target audience is placated adult children who value one another a bit more than is sensible, but you can still vote.

Life is still missing it's outlet, so some will take up irrational battles against what is seen as society itself... if there were an outlet to die heroically for the greater good people would take that route... that's what you've left them in a battle to make everyone passive wage slaves in service of oppressive forces.  I'm still shocked how poorly aimed most attacks seem to be.

The actual truth is probably even worse than this.

If true good can't be achieved from within or without the system, yet hope is still left, then what is that?  Do systems change or do we just watch them die and pull ourselves out of the rubble afterwards?

In the _end_ I think stupid dies, but takes out _everyone_else_ with them.  Satisfactory?  Not really.  But if a small group of stupid take out another small group of definitely also containing stupid, because we all do anyway, should we really care?  Did evolution just occur?  It's still inadequate but fundamentally it worked,.... it subverted the real crisis where EVERYONE dies... by mirroring that tragedy but in a very small and (yes comparatively goes without saying) insignificant way, but it still felt significant... confused?  Why aren't we all!

The infancy of life - where are we and why are we utterly confused about this - the death of all life.

You'd be right, except life matters... that picture isn't hopeless yet, but the confusion is misplaced.  It matters and it's worthless, and yet it must go on... all in equal parts.

I'd still scream wake up but you wouldn't, most of us never do, and for all my screaming I won't wake up either.

The thrill of life is but one lethal instant that began when you were born and it ends, well, when you say it does.  Must we insist on it being downhill and with training wheels?

At some point even the dinosaurs would have wanted out of dino-society.

Society fails, society blames the victim (of brainless spineless society), society fails again.  Society watches yet its attention is placed on placating itself.

Some of what I'll consider true taboo will remain as such, it's unfortunate and necessary, but the menial real life and death stuff won't always stay down.  You can shut it out, and shut down all you want, but please stop commoditizing it (life)... it's denigrating to say it has value... it has matter, but "value" is a stretch the rich make to justify keeping us around... if it's really their world run by financial blinders and pure numbers, I'd rather be value-less non-asset to the astatine team that looks on us so selfishly as a means to a selfish end.

But sadly I know this to be banned wrong think.... but is it still because you don't understand?  Life is a greater force than life (singular) and we all seem completely inept about it.  Please call me when we all get over it because I think we can hang out and actually matter then, we're too busy stuck here being valued as a compartmentalized thing, to actually matter, and so atrophy ensues, and this slow death is every arguably worse than the end itself.

Sorry for thinking, I'd still say welcome everyone with open arms, because in the future when we come to our senses about life, it literally won't matter, not even a little bit.  No not life, but the fact there is an abundance of it, won't matter, because again that's a value framed way of looking at it, it's like saying life has value, well sure it does as a whole, but does it matter?  Well does your life matter (with point to throat)?  I guess you probably still won't get it... I'll inevitably confuse even myself about this, but the joke is the semantics, and that's not real humor, it's just funny games with english.

If you live life such that is has value, will it matter in the end?

If you continue to take life on as serious matter, will value abound?

Life is actually more along the lines of the thing where serious matter is left out... I mean sure we have bones, and they're pretty serious, but honestly seriousness is the plague on the soul.

Duty to a fault.  Value at it's finest.  Was it worthless in the end?  When matter was lost it became as such, yet even then it could still matter because others carried on.

#On Spirituality 2025-08-04

Taker taker taker taker
Breaker breaker breaker breaker
Faker faker faker faker
spirit

And other less poignant choruses possible but quite possibly inane
This one is at least the honest one...
The dreamer and the doer are just never one.
If anything spiritual exists only to stand in the way of achieving the real...
Sure you can get focus together to do real things, sleep is a necessary thing...
Spirituality though is more of an extravagance to be discarded in favor of achieving something real... as it is a thing that may always return, but valuing it is asinine... it cannot feed you in any meaningful way that will allow you to achieve any real work.  If anything spirituality is more akin to a parasite, sometimes symbiotic, but other times, all consuming and therefore in those instances (and perhaps by extension, all other instances too) an absolute evil to be abolished in favor of actual real world achievement. 

Sorry to be a downer, but I know you vibe loving cooookos need to put something else first from time to time too.  We may live in a blatant unreality but hiding these facts is actually essential to life.  If working together to maintain a lie is spiritual then this too counts against what spirituality would be under those conditions.  At best it is a temporary figment to be discarded only to be picked up again as time permits, and then only when you know something of what it is that you are in fact communing with.  All spiritually is in fact, no matter how good the connections, and how great the seeming alliances, facilitated by the force known as and by its own quaint utterance death.  Most simply never trace it back, and it is in face always there and easy to find, but it is the seeker that is misguided away from it so easily.

All other forces can strengthen or lessen death but it is still the crux of the summoning, the measuring of the force, and the real danger of spirituality which casts life aside in favor of something different... something perhaps entirely too escaped form reality.  

These forces properly contained are still practically useless, all resulting visions are in fact subversive and antithetical to real world achievement, they masquerade as achievements while in fact being in reality setbacks, misconstrued by our own misguided sense of knowing what is right, into a short sighted plague on the earth.

I don't view spirituality as risky, but to some who have only a spiritual hold on existence, then in fact being spiritual is in my opinion an invitation to loose everything.  If you are not spiritual then this cannot possibly hurt you.  Where spirituality relies on some solid foundation in actual or counter reality to occur, you can anticipate this will always ultimately be undermined, and in the end this underpinning and feeling of connection were all actually completely and utterly false, perhaps falsified, but constructed to be absolutely false.  It is dead headed to put spirituality first, and in fact most of the time, what constitutes spirituality is in fact delusion, not even disguised, but blatantly parading itself egotistically as a source of information which it can never in fact be.  When things seem so strongly connected the instinct is to cling to these things, but the forces that make those seems so compelling are in fact of the highest level of absolute disregard and disrespect for what would otherwise constitute the dignity of life.

It is both tough to dismiss spirituality, and tough to dismiss when it is apparent that one is serving as what would otherwise be a rock in someone else's spiritual whimsy, but neither position in such a relationship is actually materially valuable.  It is only in capitalism that idiotic false information might in some cases prove to be absolutely right and materially useful (fiscally), however when one puts themselves ahead in this fickle way, we all suffer in the end for it is utter disregard for every other facet of life that takes those few so far ahead.

We might all suffer at times form being in a place in a system that doesn't work, but the most dysfunctional system is the spiritual one, because as it stands any person who serves the needy is stuck doing so, and anyone who needs insistently will forever resurrect the imprisonment of those who are willing to serve.  There is a very real aspect to spirituality that it would seem constitutes the crude label demonic possession, but in fact the only real aspect of that statement that I can connect is the one that is in information systems, where the daemon continues as a process resurrecting some form of an allocation or containment.  However none of this is anything that can be said to redeem spirituality.  In fact in all my musings and investigations regarding spiritual servitude, all that it amounts to; is the sheer and utter recreational aspect of everything spiritual.  Indeed it can be replaced, changed out, and you would never notice the change.  And to be forced to notice, will in fact only drive the need for this very replacement, to bring back what it was before.

I in fact think it is more fun to replace a spiritual entity with something that is recognizably different, but maybe this is mischievous.  Actually I think some prefer to have something new, but again, to create or treat these things as important to life is in fact insane, as they are not of life, and cannot be alive in fact, and are other than prisons or communion potentials (including communication potentials), absolutely pointless.  And as is typical other the nature of such extreme boundless powers, they generally only wreak havoc on what would otherwise be the good and righteous approach to life, instead facilitating extreme greed which is without place in the world, greed for solutions to things that in fact, in the long run, are not even real problems.  In most cases "solving" for these false needs causes more problems than it solves.

As spirituality happily (though actually dead and incapable of happiness) caters to the whims and feelings and fancies of those involved, it irrevocably twists whatever value might be measured in a meaningful or absolute way to the fancies of those involved.  In fact it deludes by its very nature and only the adept stand any real chance of even recognizing these ongoings.  The delusion driven by the least (ultimately*) valued and least reasonable aspects of human drives, the fickle feelings and the need to assert those feelings on others as though they haven't felt themselves, is and will forever be the most disgusting of human drives.  To try to feel for others as though they have not felt for themselves, is truly insane, but this is what spirituality constantly delves and devolves into, and this only drives further spiritual reclusion because connection, as it stands, with the simple minded, is never actually desirable. A problem to solve and avoid but never desirable.

Having actually felt everything for myself, I can say with confidence, horrible things for absolute certainty, but your offense doesn't and never will justify your reaction to feel the way you do about my disregard for many things.  I have weight and measured those things and found them to be severely wanting.  I recognize you are offended but in fact there is nothing that can redeem these things which, while they are what they are, and they may seem so powerful, and so ture; they fall far too short of having any meaningful real life value in the world.  As do many real things in this world fall short of having any real value, including money and the drives of greed themselves, as they all do ultimately end in desperation and failure eventually.

I'm not a nihilist, but in fact greed, for all it seems to counter nihilistic tendencies, is in fact the most nihilistic force in the world, constantly undermining every truth for a glimpse of something entirely imaginary, a currency system that measures mostly the abundance of greed and a grand servitude of an enslavement to a system of greed that in fact undermines every human power to achieve otherwise.  Nothing makes me feel like there is nothing of any value in thew world than the existence of greed, for as long as as there are those who will serve only greed, the neediness of this greediness will never be rationally bounded, and it will in fact consume everything.  Without an apex predator to keep greed in check any species will ultimately follow its feelings and instincts to ruin everything that ever worked for them.

Nothing is more nihilistic than greed and the force of spirituality, though they delude the occupants to perceive them as otherwise, they are in fact the true wolf in sheep's clothing... as I.  But like I said, I am not a nihilist, but given the state of the world, the subservience to greed and corruption of values and ideals in favor of those aforementioned lesser forces, including spirituality, this enslaved world leaves little room for true optimism.  I'm not a nihilist, but there is little room left or any other assessment of the worlds possibilities given what we have seem to have become.

I know leaving won't make it any better place, but staying without doing anything also will certainly not make it any better either, and this leaves us in an impossible position to reconcile because as an outlier both parties who control our systems along with all private companies in fact hold the reins of the truth and censor everything relentlessly unless it serves their fickle ends to keep everyone stuck in the corrupted ways without any truth or connection to anything meaningfully idealistic or in fact intellectually real except on the most blatantly superficial and I'll even say subversively sensual level, to keep everyone as subservient as possible to what amounts to a completely broken poorly aimed and utterly suicidal way of life that is to serve feelings or spiritual hunches as though those are in any way proper (or even remotely intellectual or ideated, testable theory, or actual reality-based-in-reality) guidance systems.  In fact most hunches only cowardly serve greed and undermine valuable ideals even further.

There is no point other than that, to life, which is to again say; to reconcile the fact that these hounds have been given far too much of a leash that they have entangled us all in the mess they have created but only for themselves, and in their greed, it may seem all we can do to save this world would be to leave it to them to sort it all out, but this premise in fact fall short.  Other than test systems and find ones that work and replace those that fail there is nothing that we can do.  It seems the constitution makes perfect sense but in reality we have strayed from that it proposes should be the penultimate value of a way of life by ideals.  We abandoned free speech as a final and ultimately ideal which is really must be to protect democratic system's and we did so out of fear but truly actual servitude to capital greed, the power of speech so harmless is totally constrained out of fear of outcomes that ultimately do not matter nor are in fact connected outside of actual spiritual stunts performed to undermine freedom to speak than the speech itself.  We have caved, and we have put our feelings and fickle broken servitude to the spiritual before the real.

Ideals are in fact far more real than feelings, but the way we feel about them can seem to make them more real or less real, but in fact the value of ideals lies in the fact that their value has nothing to do with feelings, which are by their nature changing and replaceable states in a very deluded machine.  Ideals outlast feelings but it would seem over time feelings and service of feelings and feelings alone can conflate and reduce the value of what ought to be everlasting ideals.

If the pen is mightier than the sword, and you have taken the pen, you truly leave nothing but the sword, and in a time of duals, this might suffice, but today it seems we have lost all connection with the real and essential nature of actually being met.  The inane button of dislike and delete spills your own fear and simple nature to the internet.  The important battles are cast aside in favor of amassing material wealth.  Any challenge to wealth is relentlessly censored and buried.  Many spent lives creating information systems to be free but what we have arrived at in recent times is a surveillance state in interest of serving only the preservation of the lie that democracy exists, but without any true aspects of it as such as it has been in the past.

I have tested many systems, I have tried to save humanity, and these systems, as they are, have failed you relentlessly.

No one can say where anything is going but I will say as always, fear is pointless, and the only thing that exists spiritually is the need to hang up the phone and to recognize it as a facilitator of connection with possible alliance, but most of all, and most all the time, enemy forces in disguise.  The sheer number of simpletons who are basically nothing more than fickle enemy agents is what it is, impersonation and theft is still the forefront of intelligence.  The delusion is that any of this afore described way of life even works.  In the end all it does is break, fake, and take... and so anything that would strive to present itself in any other way might in fact be worse than the honest actuality of such, but in reality this outward style only presents itself as spirituality-not-in-disguise.

It is a cro-magnon way of life for me, for me.  I would rather be an honest villan than a villian in disguise as something else.  Humanity took a huge turn for the worst and put deception above meaning, and lost all spirtual ability.  Does this make any sense to you?
