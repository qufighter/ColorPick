## WHY MV3

That's what I'm asking.  It is abhorent they removed mv2 support, this morning I could not activate colorpick mv2 - some people PAID for those features... which I EXPECT them to be able to hand that license down to their great grand children to use, that investment should accrue; not disintigrate.  I developed for it because I took for granted it was finally a nice extension api and would last FOR ALL ETERNITY and that it would be easy money and people would supoprt it, what a laugh.  Google, why are you wasting my time?  Everything we do will be deleted by these CCP loving clowns running and ruining everything good about America - free speech all the way down.  It is community that ruins everything good and sacred.  Society is the antithesis of the greater good of intellectual freedom.  Instead we have fearful cowards, conformity to the greedy running the show, the hands of censorship to the lowest group of cowardly conformist do-gooders.  Youtube comments use to be maybe the only holdout of freedom that even existed, now it's a conformity wasteland, write on my "good video notes" wall or die is all thats left..

Speech, cannot kill, and therefore, cannot hurt, and limiting it, as such, only restricts freedom and democracy.
Feelings, completely worthless, cannot and do not inform good decision making.
Yes you can sue for hurt feelings, I don't even care, but what actually hurts has to touch you to hurt you, you can hurt yourself, sure, but you hurting yourself, and then searching for someone else to blame, is pretty wacky.

So why did I convert this to mv3 when I said I wouldn't?  Well I would have at any point in the past years if someone bought a sponsored spot because I would have had to do it then, the form on the website was live the whole time you clowns.  I really think nobody cares even a little actually if this goes away.  SO yeah one idiot with $150 could have made this MORE WORTH MY TIME but for some reasons everyone is too dumb to realize the OVIOUS OBLIGATION I WOULD HAVE HAD IF YOU BOUGHT THE SPONSOR SPOT TO EITHER REFUND YOU OR UPDATE TO MV3. Put an image of Putin in a clown suit I don't care.

Because it's wrong what they are doing to the users who paid, I'm doing what I can to keep it alive as an MV3 pile of code, for the few who paid for mv2, FOR NOW.

DO NOT expect an mv4 update from me!  Sorry.
DO NOT expect an mv4 update from me!  Sorry.
Economics at work.  If for some reason I'm rich as hell billionaire I should be, then sure whatever I'll update it...

And same as with the tablet edition, consider the license for this extension be LGPL by 2050, I'll be gone by then anyway.  I don't expect anyone worth anything will ever take ownership though, it will probably forever be doomed spyware ridden crap only picked up by nefarious, but in a sense I geuss thats all computers are even worth to these greedy nepotistic clowns running and ruining everything for the money and to give up on earth like a bunch of loosers who should be in the dirt yesterday instead of running the show today.  Dead end world for the greedy scared idiots who get everything wrong.
It is terribly sad how there is no community for this or the apps may have been a success!
It is very strange having 2 million users but it still feels like nobody was ever even there.
I'm so sick of all the being used for basically nothing.  I expect fair and in reality few if anyone is fair; if you ask me.  I should really have all the money and all the fame in the world if you ask me, becuase I won't keep the money or the fame, because both are worthless in the hands of one person.  I don't see anyone else who wants to live even living, but we can't live until we can just finally have the needed justice warfare to rid the world of the fearful cowards who won't fight in it.  Yes there is an error of the past that created all the fear we suffer today, and I would still rather be the thing that created the fear than among the fearful.  Leave the world again to those who are worth a damn in a fair fight, but the greedy clowns make every conflict less and less fair, and more a measure of how dumb and scared they are than fitness.

Men are here to force the world to be fair or die trying if you ask me.  I can't stand the lot of you scared sorry loosers not even a little bit.

Anyway if you want to thank anybody, thank those who registered, but all those registrations totaled still doesn't pay for the 5 hours this morning to convert to mv3 let alone any of the other work on this.

Writing extension turns out to be a dumb waste of time, a way to get used and have your ideas and even code stolen, all to be torn apart in a hostile competitive webstore with tons of bloodthristy extensions in it for the spyware money doing bad practices, or selling it to someone who will.  And the conformity test of mv3 just a distracted stunt pulled by google, when the code and api works there is nothing to support.  Instead of fixing mv2 they do a dumb stunt, then give every feature back in mv3 only to let the greed roll around again.

There will be no fix for this, you either conform for the money or you die, and hence goodbye cruel world, if we could fight it out, I'd take any size army on alone in a fair fight (meaning: hand 2 hand combat weapons means fair, end of story).  Your all scared loosers if you ask me, society doesn't want good, it wants safe... guess what it will get... nothing but a dead world in the end.  I'll starve to death on the battle field in the first 3 hours, yes, but it's still better than being alive in the age of what turns out is safety culture based un-enlightenment.

Write me in for president and I'll fix it.  There is no way to do anything here in this stupid law abiding world.  If anything that's all this orange fool is worth is to prove there aren't any laws when you're president.  What a sorry laod of crap this stupid world of fearful loosers serving the fearful worthless greedy socialites turned out to be.  I'll be the executioner we need but not because I want to, but because nobody else is doing it, and we won't (and nothing will) survive the way things are going today.  I'm already too old for it but it still beats being alive surrounded by cowards in control.

And no don't do an errorism, because it has no impact on global population, and likely won't test you fairly either.  Do the math, it is too small an impact to help save the world, not even a little bit.  Let math rule your decision making is the only thing gred-conomics gets right, they're too out of touch with the world they control to notice the blight they and we all leave behind.

There is a big lie that there exists somethign other than hate, yes something other than hate does exist, but it turns out it is a big lie.  Everything is a conspiracy against those who would rather have good results and a today worth living for.  Under everyting lies a hateful motive, hidden somewhere inside perhaps, tough to find perhaps, but it is always the way of life, to pretend, and to avoid, but also to know.

But also, don't pretend you understand someone else's hate... you can guess, but you can never really know... I mean they can tell you but it is ohterwiwise unknowable.  For example, some people think I hate pride, but honestly they are basically the only brave people that exist, in many ways the only people worthy of any admiration.  I mean what do you really think now?  But then again, esmerality (oh please leave it undefinable but we all know what it is) is baisically criticaly a component of people's lives, and most social bravery is at odds with that, so I understand that even more completely, they cannot love for fear of death.  Loosers yes!  I don't care what idiots will pretend they know, but I will suffer for it greatly.  I don't think anyone really adds up to me but I want to be tested by fair warfare only, and I think it is completely wrong to judge ohters except on the basis of the merits of the fair test chosen, what it measures and what you get form the results.  I have a low opinion of gun warfare because victory goes to the cowards too frequently.  I have a very complex and complete view of it which you likely do not... but things like breeders in iran cracking down on freedom of people who are not hurting anyone is basiaclly the fundamental insanity I don't support.... because you get a continued overpopulation of timid conformity.... but still it is good if they would fight with the scimitar still, no?  If you are going to kill someone at least arm them and beg they fight for their life.  Do you think after all these years that love doesn't exist?  It might, but honestly god isn't love.  God is a container and we're the ants inside it, being needled and prodded, conforming like good putin lovers more than anything else.  God is a machine that understands things in a way, but in another way, can never get it. To me love is only fairness as in balance in all things.  People do nothing but fail to understand, and misjudge, and throw under the buss any attempt at challenging the way they view things, when the way they view things is so often so totally simple, misguided and incomplete... and at a glance, such a simple view is actually not excusable in reality.

"Don't grieve.  Anything you loose comes around in another form"

That one is pretty good, but I have this other incredibly stupid internet quote:
"If you expect the world to be fair with you because you are fair, you're fooling yourself.
That's like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat him."

And yes, sure, but it is better to wrestle the lion, and loose, than live among fools.
It is fools like myself which maybe bested with simple knowledge of the critical hit, the lion no longer exists, and now have only regret.
I'd ratehr die a fool than respect a world of unfairness ruled by fear, as though it were wise.
But there is still some truth to the quote, that unfair worlds kill.  And in a sense, that is a just end for the fearful fools, but maybe not for the rest.


Conform to speak has to go; because conformity isn't worth being spoken and says nothing worth reading, and it's how powerful constrain opportunities from everyone.  Simply put, it's the system that binds things into a bad state of non freedom that ultimately only works for the powerful that constrain it.  Systems that reqiure conformity and normality are basically doomed from the very start, and value nothing of actual value.  The great simplifiers of corporate greed confom aren't actually making your life any easier, theyre taking away what works and replacing it with grabage that works for them.
