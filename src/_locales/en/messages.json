Definitions follow: color - the property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way the object reflects or emits light.  pick -  choose (someone or something) from a number of alternatives, typically after careful thought.  eyedropper - a short glass tube with a rubber bulb at one end and a tiny hole at the other, for measuring out drops of medicine or other liquids, (also eyedropper tool) (in image-editing software) a function enabling the user to copy color from any part of an image."
