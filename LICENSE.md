DRAFT LICENSE this is subject to change and community feedback.  I think this license is fair but if you want something else you may inquire.  If you have a usage and I haven't inquired I wouldn't expect one but you never know.  Not stealing ColorPick is almost easier than stealing it!

Do not modify this file with the exception of filling in __blanks__.  This file must be included in some form with any source code distribution.

### BSD-old 4 CLAUSE

copyright Sam Larison of Vidsbee.com 2020

Even this license gives you some measure to utilize this software by the way!  Even when using this license, it is sill in many cases required you license host seats as described elsewhere in this license, especially when applicable (i.e. if you are releasing your version of this software and selling licenses to use it).

For more awareness of the existing licensing see license.html

To better define the license, it is freeware, with the ability to register.  You are not required to release freeware, and in fact it is encouraged that you independently sell license seats yourself, while you purchase the equivalent license seats for your license via http://vidsbee.com/ColorPick/Upgrade/ ( to purchase the initial license package see http://vidsbee.com/ColorPick ) in order to stay compliant with this license.  There are other source code requirements that must be met; but while selling licenses is not one of them, it is strongly encouraged, and even required if you are selling licenses in any way.

FIN

# Other Available Licenses

1) Having purchased the extension license for all hosts that the code may run on now, and as the code you distribute may run in the future, additional licenses purchased for those host seats.
   Or Having calculated and adjusted your sale cost to include registration value, purchase additional licensed hosts quarterly on behalf of; or as performed by the registered user(s).
2) That you follow the license provided, and make your work open source, and under one of these licenses, while the color pick software included holds this very license. ( https://github.com/qufighter/ColorPick/LICENSE.md )

### CC SA or GPL
for commercial purpose to be end user licensed as described above, 
or exclusively non commercial purpose with these license requirements intact for those who would choose to license this software themselves.

If you choose to use a single license and track registrations in your own system, you can upgrade your license quarterly using the following system:

# Other Available Licenses

If you wish to use a component of ColorPick for a commercial endeavor or have found a way to make income from your use of this software, please consider
purchasing a license for the component.  This is for use in situations where the "Other Available Licenses" clause listed above are unsatisfactory.

! Depending on how you release your source code this license cost may vary, so please reach out with how you want to license it and we can go from there.  If you absolutely cannot pose any licensing restrictions then this software is likely very difficult to license !

If restrictions can be applied to exclude utilization of the source code for commercial endeavors, and your own endeavor is non commercial, purchasing a special license outside of those defined above isn't strictly needed as long as you follow this license agreement.

As you would likely utilize less than the entire source code, but may not understand how we value the components don't hesitate to ask about component pricing.

In the unlikely event that you do need to register entire software for COMMERCIAL or OTHERWISE usage.

 - "Unrestricted" closed source license A $300000 (you may sell the resultant software result and may transfer this license to do so another by relinquishing your right to the license)
 - "Unrestricted" closed source license B $30000 (you may sell the resultant software result but may not transfer this license to do so another, they must purchase their own license)
 - "Unrestricted" open source license key ~60 hosts $30 (you will post your code modifications as they pertain to this project to a fork on github, or your entire source used as prescribed) 
   - ( You must not imply that this license will be inherited on transfer of the source code, however the source code is freely available for non commercial usage and tinkering as long as the resultant source code is provided to the public, and the program is released according to the same license, so some components of your program (namely this program) may not strictly be open source under this license, however for non commercial usage they will be.  Commercial users either must purchase the appropriate license hosts(seats) or discounted seats for `commercial source code usage for educational programs` at 50% rate if sold.  Open source usage without intent for profit is always allowable providing the source code is published as a fork or in credit to this license and repository as per https://github.com/qufighter/ColorPick/LICENSE.md however registering the applicable license hosts never hurts )

So that is the entire program; other parts which may already be genuinely open sourced; or are otherwise minor components of the program, may go for significantly less than these rates.

## Meaning "Unrestricted"

These licenses come with the following restrictions:
  - You make no claim to the source code, your license is for a copy with certain exclusive rights to utilize as you see fit in your own projects, not a license to compete with vidsbee.com enterprises, but a partnership by which you may utilize the software offerings for your own independent endeavor adapting the software as you see fit for your purpose without violating the rights granted by this license. Your usage of this source code is provided only in so far as your usage does not violate this license.
  - Closed source is not a mandatory clause of any offering.  Indeed your efforts may expose javascript source code modifications, and it is preferred that you make no attempt to obfuscate said source code changes.  Obfuscating is generally considered a bad practice and this license discourages it.  In so far as source code is available (especially for sale) this license should also be made available and included in any such exposure or offering.
  - You will please not use the software for nefarious, fascist or exclusive ends.





Once the copyright holder's rights inevitably expire (likely by the year 3500) this software should be considered GPL or ## CC SA (at least as described above, if not more liberal standard license) however efforts may be attempted to keep the registration form online and this licensing intact for the benefit of future generations.  This may depend on the licensing and needs of the time based on applicable standards, but the intention is to ensure this project outlives what narrow inspiration created it.  Perhaps there is more value here than meets the eye.






# IMPORTANT

Direct competition of the same extension in any web store (such as the chrome webstore) may not in any case be permitted.

It is unlikely I will compete with you or take your independent listing so long as you register appropriate host seats at the going rate.  Failure to register host seats as deemed appropriate by this license will in many cases forfeit your rights granted by this software license, along with any right to your listing, however there may be time granted for remediations to be applied.

Web stores are not the same as extension code repositories.  Listing source code for modifications is encouraged and required by most applicable licenses.

You are not required to re-brand the extension but you must not misrepresent that you are the arbiter of support for the software you release, as I SL arbitrate support for this software.  You are free to encourage people to buy the http://vidsbee.com/ColorPick license; or to hide the fact that behind the scenes you will so purchase stated licenses as deemed appropriate.  Think of the franchise model, where you could also optionally sell example brand product as something else entirely, but you may not sell sample brand as the exact parent corporation itself ( in this case, think vidsbee.com ), but also may not deny the existence of the parent brand as distinct. The store front cannot communicate on behalf of the entire franchise but does represent an important endpoint for user support, while not speaking on behalf of the franchise as a whole.  This may seem convoluted but it is rather straight forward.  Do not speak on behalf of vidsbee.com or release software on their behalf that is not their own software.  You may state that your software is ColorPick Eyedropper so long as it is largely intact and unmodified, but you are granted liberties as long as you clearly indicate that you took those (e.g "with improvements by ________ detailed here (or linked)" which can be direct and descriptive, or indirect and a source code reference.  As long as your improvement's source code are readily available to the public, and clearly marked and marketed as improvements on top of the base software package, and not misrepresented as the official base features, you are free to improve upon the software as you see fit.  If vidsbee.com does not see your release as an improvement (i.e. if it makes violations into user privacy) then keep in mind your right to use the branding material may be revoked at any time for any good reason that is not adequately resolved.
